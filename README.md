color, entity, and number

cen is a dictionary, an immature language, a numbering system for quick reference. General/metaphorical meaning of 0~9 in cen:

|Number		|Entity/meaning/reference				|Color	|HTML Color Code|
|---		|---									|---	|---			|
|0			|nothingness. not sure. unspecified		|none	|N.A.			|
|1			|basis, fundamental, physical			|black	|2c0e0e			|
|2			|consciousness, self, core, awareness	|white	|e2fffe			|
|3			|solid, built, civ works	  			|blue	|84bbe3			|
|4			|fluent, flowing, interpersonal			|green	|41d560			|

|8			|political, community, social			|purple	|5c2196			|
|9			|mystical, unconsciousness, complex		|brown	|eeaa66			|


Same as other numbering systems, the initial purpose of creating cen is to speed up recording and communication with a clear classification. Like the number of buses (hi, i'm taking the 42A bus home today), library decimal classification systems, etc. 

Not like the other numbering systems, cen is personal for Martha and the communication happens only when Martha talks to Martha. 

Like the other numbering systems, people would make those numbers some meanings for easy memory. 

Very different from the other numbering systems, though the numbers in cen have consistent basic meanings. The numbers don't have fixed meanings in cen. Their meanings grow/change over time when Martha uses them every day. 

Special from other numbering systems, numbers in cen can do arithmetic sometimes: 

2 means personal, 2+2=4 means interpersonal, 4+4=8 means social. This was not deliberately invented or at least discovered later than the definition of the frame of 0 to 9. You can argue that this is totally subjective. Yes, it is. i would also say that when a person did a work that physically remained on Earth became a part of our civilization can be interpreted as 2+1=3. i can do this all day. 

- i am 2, 5 is work, work is something i do when i am with the tools which are from 3 (civilization). 
- 4 is the other person to me, i am 2, 2+4=6 means romance and beauty and so on.
- when i work, it is for the idealism. That's 2+5=7.
- when people live with the human build, it is for idealism as well. That's 4+3=7 again.
- if ever 6+1=7, it must be romance needs a bit of physical to become ideal. 

i wish i could finish the interpretation of addition in cen today. It doesn't mean that i interpret the numbers casually. On the contrary, the interpretation is the progress of me developing and understanding cen. If you read Neil Postman, you know that what i am saying is that cen makes who i am when i use it. Be cautious about all tools.

i was still in doubt for a second whether i should open this repo since this openingness of one of my core functions meant giving up quite a part of my privacy. those i claimed that i never had or would like to have privacy. in other words, posting the whole of cen dictionary is giving out the right to decode my encoded records of life, especially [fluxRec](https://github.com/treesess/fluxRec). 

the hesitation only lasted for a second since i believed technology would override the invention of privacy sooner not later.
